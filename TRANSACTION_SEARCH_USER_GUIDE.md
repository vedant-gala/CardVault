## Active Filters Display

### Understanding Filter Badges

### Filter Count Indicator

## Pagination

### Why Pagination?

- Improves performance with large transaction histories
- Loads only the transactions you're viewing
- Faster page loads and smoother experience

### Changing Page Size

1. At the bottom of the transaction list, find "Rows per page"
2. Click the dropdown
3. Choose from:
   - **10** - Compact view, more pages
   - **25** - Balanced view
   - **50** - Standard view (default)
   - **100** - See more at once

### Navigating Pages

Use the pagination controls at the bottom:

- **âŸ¨âŸ¨** (First) - Jump to page 1
- **âŸ¨** (Previous) - Go back one page
- **Page Numbers** - Click any page number to jump to it
- **âŸ©** (Next) - Go forward one page
- **âŸ©âŸ©** (Last) - Jump to last page

### Page Information

The pagination shows:
- "Showing X to Y of Z transactions"
- Example: "Showing 1 to 50 of 247 transactions"
- Helps you understand how many results match your filters

### Auto-Reset to Page 1

- When you change filters, the page automatically resets to 1
- Ensures you don't miss results from filter changes

## Performance Tips

1. **Use Specific Filters**: The more specific your filters, the faster the results
2. **Start with Date Ranges**: Filtering by date is very efficient
3. **Use Search for Specific Merchants**: Type a few letters to quickly find a merchant
4. **Combine Filters**: Multiple filters work together to narrow results efficiently

## Common Workflows

### Monthly Budget Review

1. Set date range to last month
2. Sort by category
3. Review each category's spending
4. Use amount filters to find large expenses

### Card Comparison

1. Filter by one card
2. Note total spending
3. Clear filters
4. Filter by another card
5. Compare spending patterns

### Expense Report Generation

1. Set date range for reporting period
2. Filter by relevant categories
3. Sort by amount (High to Low)
4. Review and note top expenses

### Finding Duplicate Transactions

1. Search for merchant name
2. Sort by date
3. Look for transactions with same amount on same day

### Tracking Subscriptions

1. Search for service name (e.g., "Netflix")
2. Sort by date
3. Verify recurring charges

## Keyboard Tips

- **Tab** - Navigate between filter controls
- **Enter** - Apply search or date selection
- **Escape** - Close date picker or dropdown
- **Space** - Toggle checkboxes

## Troubleshooting

### No Results Found

- Check if filters are too restrictive
- Click "Clear All" to reset
- Verify date ranges are correct
- Make sure you have transactions in the selected period

### Search Not Finding Expected Results

- Check spelling of merchant name
- Try partial words (e.g., "star" instead of "starbucks")
- Search is case-insensitive
- Some merchants may have different names than expected

### Filters Not Working Together

- All filters work with AND logic
- Example: Category=Food AND Amount>500 means both must be true
- If you need OR logic, apply filters separately

### Slow Performance

- Reduce page size if displaying 100 transactions
- Use more specific date ranges
- The system is optimized, but very large datasets may take a moment

## Best Practices

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with general filters, then add more specific ones
2. **Save Common Queries Mentally**: Remember your most-used filter combinations
3. **Use Date Filters First**: Date filtering is the most efficient
4. **Regular Reviews**: Use filters to review spending weekly/monthly
5. **Experiment**: Try different filter combinations to discover insights

## Future Features Coming

Based on your feedback, we're considering:
- Saved filter presets
- Quick filter buttons (Last 30 Days, This Month, etc.)
- Export filtered results
- URL-based filter sharing
